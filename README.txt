# Star-Trek-Scripts-Analysis
Collecting, cleaning and a simple first analysis of number of lines by each character for all Star Trek series scripts.

The notebook first steps through the collection of text data from http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/index.html for scripts for each episode of each Star Trek series, the cleaning process and the structure of the resulting JSON files.

The output is two JSON files, one containing the raw text for each series, the other containing collated lines spoken by each character.

The notebook then shows a simple analysis for the number of lines spoken by each character.

Feel free to improve and extend!
